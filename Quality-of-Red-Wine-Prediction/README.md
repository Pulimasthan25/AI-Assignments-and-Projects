<!-- Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.
-->
<!--The data set is related to different red wine samples of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The quality of wine is scored between 0 (lowest) and 10 (highest). The objective of this project is to predict the wine quality using the wine properties provided in the data set.-->

The objective of this project is to predict the wine quality using the wine properties provided in the data set.
## Data Set
The Data set used in this project is taken from this [Red Wine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUHAD31NotXun5FB69V9l_p016JEjtOlpqTZvYjlbVSFlNo6jSVfiw6BzKwCMUcP4yeLIkxTf2s_Rh/pubhtml) file, Which is available on Google.
